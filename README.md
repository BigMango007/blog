My Personal Blog I did it to prove that I can use SpringBoot frame work
I met several problem during the development. The most impressive one is the version confilict , Spring 2.4 is some kinds different with 1.5.
Lucklly I solve it by reading official document.

· Use components from Semantic UI to build Front-End pages.
· Build Back-End functions by using the Spring Boot + Thymeleaf + JPA 
· Encrypt the administrator password by MD5 to resist cyber hacking from the internet
· Edit and typesetting blog text with the MarkDown Editor(editor.md)
· Develop Exception handler class and custom error pages(404 , 500 ,etc.) to intercept exceptions globally and redirect to custom error pages.
